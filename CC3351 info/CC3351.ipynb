    "# MAC vs MAC address\n",
    "\n",
    "What is MAC (Medium Access Control)?\n",
    "\n",
    "MAC is a sub-layer of the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) in the OSI model. Its job is to control how data is transmitted over a shared medium (like Wi-Fi or Ethernet). It determines:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Who gets to talk and when – Since multiple devices can be connected to the same medium, MAC protocols manage access to avoid collisions.\n",
    "    Framing and addressing – It structures data into frames and assigns each device a unique address (MAC address).\n",
    "    Error detection – It helps detect errors in transmission and ensures reliable communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "MAC is implemented in hardware and firmware, meaning that every Wi-Fi or Bluetooth chip has a MAC controller responsible for handling transmissions.\n",
    "2. What is a MAC Address?\n",
    "\n",
    "A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC) by the manufacturer. Think of it like a serial number but for networking."
