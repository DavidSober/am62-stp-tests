    "    Less CPU usage in many cases because context switching between threads is cheaper than switching between processes.\n",
    "    Limited by Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) if you’re doing CPU-bound tasks in Python, but if your work is mostly I/O-bound (e.g., network requests, file handling, GUI updates), QThread is often the better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiprocessing (New Processes)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Creates separate processes, which do not share memory directly.\n",
    "    Higher CPU overhead because each process has its own memory space and needs inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms to share data.\n",
    "    Bypasses Python’s GIL, making it better suited for CPU-intensive tasks (e.g., heavy computations, number crunching).\n",
    "    More system resource consumption since each process needs separate memory allocation\n",
